# Arithmatic Coding

This code is organized to take an input image and prodive
two files as output one `encode.npy` and the other is `prob.npy` and the output in `output.(img extenstion)`

1.encode.npy is a numpy file that contain the compressed data
from the `image`
2.prob.npy is the that contain the probabilities of all symbols

## important note: use python `3.7` as some of the code won't work with python 2 and

may produce invalid output

## Note

the input of this program is :
1.block_size
2.the float type :

- 0 for `float16`
- 1 for `float32`
- 2 for `float64`
- defualt is `float16`
